Hello 
me (ahmadruz98@gmail.com)
I am a beginner in Ruby On Rails and I noticed you did an excellant job in utilising HTML serenity template in spree commerce.
I wanted to learn how to use template on spree, do you still have the serenity HTML template ? For me to compare before and after you use 
the files in rails aplication.
